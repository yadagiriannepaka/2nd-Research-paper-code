the environmental agency are starting to promote reducing car in certain communities some may argue why is there a need to reduce the amount of cars in a community but on the other hand that community may be over populated or congested of cars if this is so then this will just have another negative impact of the environment the purpose of the program is to benefit the area you are and to lessen then the issue of car usages all in all the suburbs are taking action to create denser cities\\n\\nprograms are also being created to spread the news of car free day the purpose for care free day in bogota  columbia is a day you participate in to prevent traffic jams for example in source 3 it states millions of colombians hiked biked and skated or took buses to work during a car free day this day isnt ment for people who live in bogota colombia but they are trying to influence this tradition in several other countires other may agree of this day being pointless  but i can see this having a huge impact on the world sooner or later this day will become a tradition not only in several other countries but also in the united states it also states in source 3 its a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pulltion said a bussniessman especially since it rained on the car free day this didnt stop nor discourage anyone from participating in the event the event turned out to be a huge success and reduced the amount of smog that day in my perspective we are all come together as one to build our community together it takes more thenone person to have such a huge impact on the world the goal if to lessen the usage of car to have a positive effect on the environment the influence of the car free day is just one step closer to reaching that goal this will is why programs are being creates to spread the news of car free day\\n\\nafter looking of the causes and effects of limiting car usage  it all comes down to having a big influence on the world it takes one area such as bogota columbia to have a huge impact in our every day lives  our car is our main resource for transportation but this should change not only are you capable of helping to have a postive effect on the environment but so am i this just shows how if we are all willing to come together as a community we are capable of creating a healthier environment this is why the world should influence limiting car usage',\n",

of america be able to vote for who they want their president to be because the electoral college has some major flaws and simply because people have their rights i believe that we should let the people be able to make their own choices\\n\\nthe electoral college has major flaws something bad is bound to happen if we keep letting them make the peoples decisions source a in paragraph 12 states in 1968 a shift of just 41971 votes would have deadlocked the election in 1976 a tie would have occurred if a mere 5559 voters in ohio and 3687 voters in hawaii had voted the other way the election is literally only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe it would be hard to believe that the people of the united states would want to be embarrassed because we cant even choose a presidential leader correctly the other countries would take us as a joke we would simply look like fools another thing is what would we do if there were a tie in the electoral vote source b also in paragraph 12 says perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote and with that being said the election would be taken to the hor house of representatives where state delegations vote on the president and because each state casts only one vote the single representative from wyoming representing only 500000 voters would have much to say as the 55 representatives from california who represents 35 million that is the same population as wyoming only times 70 that is a tremendous difference in population dont let our country plummet into bad election if anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in ohio they have yet to make it\\n\\never since our founding fathers have settled here in america and made the decloration of independence in the late 1700s the amendments and everything that gives us the right to be free the people have had the right to vote with the electoral college the people of america will not be able to freely use that right source c says at the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winnertakeall system in each state candidates dont spend time in states they know they have a chance of winning focusing only on the right races in the swing states seventeen states didnt even see the candidates during the campaign in 2000 those states including rhode island and south carolina voters in the 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see not one not two but zero campaign ads just as source d states the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor the american people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors and keep in mind that those electors possibly could defy the will of the people what if a state sends two state of electors to congress it happened in 1960 with hawaii and luckily vp richard nixon validated only his opponents electors but made sure to do so without establishing a precedent what if it happened again remember when al gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency to george w bush thank that to the electoral college in the 2000 us presidential race al gore recieved more individual votes that george w bush nationwide but bush won the election recieving 271 electoral votes to gores 266 this year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency and yet the electoral college still has its defenders but why\\n\\nfirst of all source e states so other things being equal a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small one does but the problem with this is is that its simply unfair the smaller states should get just as much attention as the bigger states do this is like saying that on the baseball field the bigger and stronger kids should be the ones picked first and be able to play but the smaller kids dont get to play it is not fair to the people in the smaller states like wyoming to be considered not as good as the state of california also in paragraph 20 of source f says they are the most thoughtful voters on average and for the further reason that they will have recieved the most information and attention from the candidates and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election once again this statement is unfair this is favoritism this is saying that the better and bigger states should get all the attention just because they are more thoughtful once again people deserve to have their rights so i say let them vote\\n\\npeople want to make their own decisions its who we are as a person we want to be able to have responsibilities we want to feel important with the electoral college we wont be able to get that feeling because we feel we arent important enough to vote so its official the electoral college is unfair outdated and irrational the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality and the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind that we have now and theres a pretty good reason its fair theres only one thing i have to say to you

       " 'in a bid to improve the states environment and save money limiting car usage would be a great idea for our state according to the passage paris a model for limiting car traffic paris has been successful in reducing traffic congestion and air pollution by limiting the number of cars on the streets the passage states from 1990 to 2000 the number of cars entering the city center decreased by 60 percent this is quite impressive and shows that limiting car usage is possible also there are many parking areas in paris that are designated for cars but are closed off to traffic this is an excellent way to reduce the number of cars on the streets\\n\\nmoreover in the passage the economics of traffic congestion it is stated that the cost of traffic congestion is estimated to be 160 billion a year this is a staggering amount and it could be a good idea to save money by limiting car usage now one might argue that limiting car usage would lead to a decrease in convenience however there are many alternatives to cars such as public transportation biking and walking which can be just as quick and convenient for example in paris there is a bikesharing program called velib which allows people to rent a bike at a station near them and return it at another station in a different location this is a great way to get around the city and avoid traffic\\nfinally in the passage the benefits of walking it is stated that walking is good for our health the passage notes walking is a great way to improve your health it can lower your risk of heart disease stroke and diabetes this is because walking is a form of exercise and exercise is known to be good for our health by limiting car usage people would have to walk more which would lead to better health for the citizens of our state\\nin conclusion limiting car usage would have many advantages for our state it would improve the environment reduce traffic congestion and air pollution and even save money there are many alternatives to cars and people would benefit from them so i think that our state should consider limiting car usage',\n",

happens with the increase of greenhouse gases in the world in just a few years this may not be the same situation instead of enjoying your breath you may be coughing or choking on the polluted air in the past few decades our air pollution has gone up drastically and most of that comes from our cars according to source 1 written by elisabeth rosenthal cars in europe make up 12 percent of its greenhouse gases and up to 50 percent in areas in the united states thats a whole lot rest assured though there is an easy and crucial way we can begin to cut down those numbers we must begin to limit our car usage\\n\\nalready you may question this and begin to wonder if it is even a possible or logical request well it is in many places throughout the world communities have begun to forget about their cars and use bikes walking and more public transportation options instead of their cars it can happen in in german suburb life goes on without cars  by elisabeth rosenthal she informs us about an upscale community in vauban germany where its residents have given up their reliance on cars its streets have no cars except for the tram that runs to its downtown areas while everyone is still allowed to own a car and some do they must park it at one of the only two areas to park in large garages where an owner must buy a space for up to 40000 you may think that its crazy but in reality it is not the structure of the city allows almost everything to be in close proximity to one another reducing the need for a car many citizens have reported to be feeling better and happier as they feel more carefree and have the stress that cars bring removed from their lives this helps to reduce the emission produced by cars and vauban is one of the most successful cities and have been an influence in many areas\\n\\nnow if you are not up to the idea of completely giving up your car then there are several alternatives that you can do to help and will still reduce and limit your car usage in source 3 by andrew selsky mr selsky brings to us a fairly new tradition that started about 3 years ago in bogota colombia bogota is colombias capital and one of the most populated cities bogota has a citywide day called day without cars it is simple enough buses and taxis are only permitted while cars are banned millions of people walked biked skated or found other ways of getting to work and frankly enjoyed it other citizens reported it as a fun day to take away stress while helping our endangered enviroment this day that started only 3 days ago has now spread to other areas such as cali and valledupar and asuncion paraguay not only do these days help the enviroment but it also helps the citizens all throughout bogota new parks and sports centers have been built old and cracked sidewalks have been replaced with smooth ones and new areas for income such as restaurants and upscale shopes have popped up around the city as well the reason for the building and new employment of jobs is so that people will have reasons to walk around and allow for it to be more convient for others who work near by the areas we also notice a similar idea arise in the lovely city of paris france for those who dont know while paris is known for its impressive architecture and beautiful sights it also has a bad reputation of being very polluted this pollution comes from the amount of tourists it recieves as well as the different and populous amounts of motor transportation in source 2 by robert duffer we see he examines several days in which the city of paris bans driving due to the record amounts of pollution in the air for those who were driving when they werent supposed to be were fined and a few even had their car impounded for their reactions to the fine unfortunately the government established in paris realized that they had to do this after 5 full days of intensifying smog at first many were scared confused and even upset as to why this was happening but they began to see that it was neccessary once their levels of smog began to normalize congestion is paris was down about 60 percent all in all we need to begin limiting our usage of cars from the examples provided it shows that in the end it isnt such a bad thing after all it increases activities to do work opportunities for people and reduces air pollution while they were able to save paris this time next time they may not be so lucky in the united states according to source 4 which is very reliable we actually see a decrease in car usage overall these rates have dropped for several reasons and have about the same results and benefits people have begun getting healthier emission rates have decreased\\n\\nwhile the idea of limiting car usage may scare some people it is proved to be extremely helpful limiting car usage helps reduce emissions and increases job opportunities and everything',\n",

       " 'dear senator\\n\\ni am writing in response to the ongoing debate over the electoral college and the method of selecting the president of the united states i am a firm believer that the electoral college should be kept and i will outline my reasoning below\\nfirstly the electoral college is a system of checks and balances that is designed to ensure that the president is elected by a broad coalition of states rather than simply the most populous ones this is important because it prevents the election from being decided solely by the interests of a few large states and instead requires the president to have widespread support across the country as the text from the atlantic argues the electoral college is not a quirk of the constitution but a feature of it the atlantic\\nsecondly the electoral college is a direct reflection of the system of representation that is outlined in the constitution the constitution grants congress the power to set the size of the house of representatives which in turn affects the number of electoral votes that each state has this means that smaller states are able to have a greater say in the election than they would if the election were decided by popular vote as the text from the new york times states the electoral college is a compromise between the large and small states and it is in the constitution the new york times\\ni understand that some argue that the electoral college is outdated and unfair but i believe that it is still a valuable part of our democratic system for example if the election were decided by popular vote candidates would only need to focus on the most populous areas of the country rather than spreading their efforts across the entire country this could lead to a situation where the president is elected without receiving a majority of the popular vote which would be a violation of the principles of democracy\\nfinally i would like to address the argument that the electoral college is a source of disenfranchisement for voters in some states while it is true that some states have a greater number of electoral votes than others this is not necessarily a problem the electoral college is designed to ensure that the president is elected by a broad coalition of states and not simply by the most populous ones this means that voters in smaller states have a greater say in the election than they would if the election were decided by popular vote\\nin conclusion i believe that the electoral college should be kept in place for the following reasons it is a system of checks and balances it is a direct reflection of the system of representation outlined in the constitution and it helps to ensure that the president is elected by a broad coalition of states i understand that there are counterarguments to this position but i',\n",

and we as a nation should pay no heed\\n\\nthe biggest and most obvious problem with our current electoral college system is that it unfairly represents voters in the states an example of this unfairness towards voters propagated by the system is expressed in in defense of the electoral college five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president by richard a posner where it is stated that in the 2012 election between rodney and obama florida gave all of its electoral votes towards obama when he only won 617 percent of the vote this method completely exludes the opinion of the minority that 483 percent of people in florida who didnt vote for obama got their say taken away their opinion no longer mattered to the election because all of the electors were given to obama by a small majority a second unfairness to the voters is the attention taken away from any voter not in a swing state in the article written by bradford plumer named the indefensible electoral college why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong it is said that in the 2000 election that seventeen states got no attention from the candidates whatsoever this system gives undeserved attention to a few swing states which will decide the election because of our outdated system of the electoral college if popular vote was instituted the attention given to voters of all states would be equal as every vote from every state matters\\n\\na problem with the electoral college that could possibly outshine the unfairness of it would be the potential for catastrophe that it brings as is stated in the indefensible electoral college why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by bradford plumer the electors presented by the states according to popular vote are not even obliged to vote for the candidate they said they would even though this may be a rare occurace a single elector betraying his party could cause misrepresentation of millions of americans another possible disaster would be a tie vote in the electoral college this situation as explained in the same article would cause a vastly unfair election incomparable even to the unfairness of the normal system this horrible system consists of each state getting one vote for the president which when you consider that some states have many times the population of others means that millions upon millions of people could have the same say a a couple hundred thousands an injustice unthinkable in our society and one that could be stopped by instituting a popular vote system\\n\\nthe arguments against popular vote presented in in defense of the electoral college five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president by richard a posner are unrealistic unsupported or insignificant the argument presented as certainty of outcome says that a dispute over popular vote would be much more common but provides no evidence to support the claim invalidating it the articles second argument states that candidates would have more incentive to stay in their region if popular vote were implemented but this entire argument relies on the fact that there are not enough electors in any one region in order to elect a president although this is true it doesnt matter because the same is true of population no one region has an overwhelming population advantage over others and population is what matters in popular vote the third argument is the most illogical stating that the electoral colleges tendency of causing only swing states to matter is actually a good thing because it increases the education of the populations of those states by the increased attention by the candidate therefore the educated would decide the vote making it more accurate this is a parochial and shortsighted viewpoint not considering the fact that the system of popular vote would make candidates pay attention to all populations making all voters more educated rather than having some elite educated aristocracy in the swing states the articles fourth argument is possibly even more deluded than the third stating that large states get more attention because of the electoral college which balances out the fact that states have hugely varying populations but the exact same thing would happen in popular vote because some states have larger populations and candidates need larger populations for election in popular vote the electoral college in this instance changes nothing meaning that the argument leads nowhere the only argument presented in in defense of the electoral college five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president by richard a posner that has any merit is the fifth which shows that popular vote could lead to possibly complicated runoff elections although that is a disadvantage of popular vote i believe that the vast unfairness and averting disaster is worth the cost of slightly complex runoff elections\\n\\nto support the electoral college one must rely on unrealistic or insignificant evidence this evidence can be easily refuted and outwieghed by strong evidence from the opposing side to support the electoral college you are supporting unfairness and catastrophe and

       " 'dear mr senator i believe that the way our elections are run are not what is best for the united states the electoral college is changing the way that we originally set out to vote and is making things unfair for the citizens who vote i propose that the electoral college is taken away all together in order for elections to be more fair and more like the original intention of the us with most states following the winner takes all idea the winner of the general public may not be the candidate that wins the elections these times are rare but they happened before there is nothing that is stopping them from happening again\\n\\na lot of voters who are not very well educated may not even understand what the electoral college is or what they are actually voting for when they vote instead of voting for the candidate that they want as the next president they are voting for a group of electors that decide who will win sometimes the electors that are assigned to that candidate will not vote for them this process also seems to discriminate against the less populated states because they dont have as much a say in the college and are often forgotten in the rush of propaganda and arent really aware of who they should pick and why they should pick them in the indefensible electoral college why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by bradford plumer plumer explains that one of the best arguments against the electoral college is that the rate of disaster is so high in 2000 there was a electoral crisis based upon the electoral college because al gore received more individual votes but george w bush still won the election\\n\\nanother reason that this process is so unstable is the way that it makes voters feel about voting in large states where this a majority of either republican or democrats voters may think that if they are in the minority and the other party will surely win the election whats the point of voting if there was no electoral college the votes that they put in could contribute to the greater pool of that parties voters while with electoral college the votes are pointless and basically disappear that to me is robbing the citizens of the us of their right to vote according to richard a posner the electoral college restores some of the weight that the large states hold in a presidental election however the large states may not have all of one party and those other votes can really make a difference\\n\\nsome argue that a few votes can not do a lot and that the electoral college is a far more organized way to conduct the voting but every vote counts and if every voter understood why they were voting for who they were voting for then the president may be a majority favorite it seems unfair that the president of the united states the most important man in the country is not truely picked by the voters but by the elctoral college the office of the federal register says that the electors that are selected are chosen by the candidates political party but that stae laws differ on how they are specifically selected this way does not seem like the best way of performing the task and i can see how it results in issues trusting the weight of the united stated on the the backs iof only 538 electors is not the most stable way to perform an election why trust a select group with this descion if the whole united states can contribute to it\\n\\ni think that it is criticall that we change the idea of an electoral college to the idea that all of the people in the united states are able to contribute equally to who should be the next president based on what they believe is right bradfordd plummer believes that one of the most worrying thoughts is that there will be a tie with the electors if that were to occur the elction would fall into the hands of the house of representitives resulting in all the states no matter what their population is having the same amount of votes casuing a president that may be very far away than what the majority of the united states actually wants this may seem unlikely but in fact there have already been many close calls in 1968 only 41971 votes would have deadlockes the election in 1976 a tie would have happened if 5559 voters in hawaii and 3687 voters in hawaii had voted the other way the indefensibel electoral college why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by bradofrd plummer a tie may occur and if it does a lot of citizens would be very upset that the president did not win by popularity but by the electoral college\\n\\nthere are many reasons that the elctoral college is unfair to the voters of the us state inequality diaster ties and people loosing the urge to vote the list goes on and on and if this doesnt make you see what is wrong with this system than i dont know what will i hope you take this information to good use and use it to tear down this unfair system once and for all if we really want to be a democracy than we have to do away with this system many of americans believe that this is the best way and several have published interesting papers on that topic that may chaneg the minds of people who are still for it i hope this dream to get rid of the unfair and terrible system that is the electoral college is accomplished soon',\n",

       " 'car usage is very popular in this world we have come to know it used for many means of transportation like going to work school social events or just simply going shopping or hanging out with friends those are some up sides to having and using a car but they are some down sides as well i will be explaining the down sides of using a car as well as the advantages of limiting car usage\\n\\nmy first reason in this topic that i have chosen to tell you about are carfree cities what are carfree cities well the name says it all is a new project they are working on in europe of this city who is car free this new city has no cars no street parking no driveways or or home garages why do they exist well the obvious answer is to minimize car pollution that are creating green house gases and are polluting the air and more places can adopt this idea and have more carfree cities so we can save the planet and ultimately save our selves from extinction because we did not know how to maintain our planet clean also a thing a like about this new carfree city is that theres a main street where theres all the stores at a walking distance like how great is that u can just take a ten to twenty minute walk and go shopping for anything like grocery shoes clothe restaurants instead of driving to a mall along some distant highway and ultimately that is where everybody is so hanging out with your friends and meeting all up in one place is at a walking distance and if you dont have any friends well you make new friends at this main street because that is where everybody is\\n\\nanother great reason for considering less car usage is less traffic who does not like less traffic everybody hates traffic is slow boring and annoying now if we have less traffic that means we have less commute time when trying to get to work if you have a job that is far from your home and that means you get to work sooner and on time and hopefully get a raise because you feel like you dont get paid enough to do what you do also if we have less traffic we have less commute time and what does that mean well it can mean multiple things like having more time to sleep because you dont have to worry about waking up early to beat the morning traffic like my mom and plenty of other people do at the end of the day you will be able to get home quicker so you can spend more time with your family and do stuff you usually cant because of the time you spend at traffic\\n\\nmy last reason is a very important reason and it is simply safety think about it it is simply just common sense if they are less cars in the road at one time then the chances of car accidents decreases now i dont know about you but that sounds like a win win to me one theres less accidents so theres less people in the hospital so they dont have hospital bills to worry about and less accidents means less traffic as well and also if you ban the cars for a day or have one of them carfree cities you have less drunk drivers one because they dont have a car so they will probably just drink at home and two if the bar or where ever is that there going to drink is close enough then they can just walk there sober and walk back to the house drunk instead of being in a car a causing a fatal accident\\n\\nultimately i feel that the usage of cars should be limmited because of many reasons this reasons are as follows less car pollution living in a carfree city so you are able to walk everywhere less traffic less commute time having more time to do stuff and last but not least the safety of drivers personally i think we should supervise the usage of automobiles and have more carfree cities and have days where car usage is baned or restricted by some amount',\n",

       " 'when looking at the world from a birds eye view it is possible to see the beauty in the world even so in certain developed and developing areas the people are choking the choking is not just supported by the violated environment but along with that society is an advocate for the pain of the people an intrugal part of the current society is the usage of cars with the progressing world also comes regress and according to an article written by the new york times in 2013 it was stated that in countries such as the united states of america americans are buying less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by this eventually has lead to a limiting in car usage in the usa although the car industry may suffer from this it is essential to note that the limiting in car usage does not really have a negative impact on the public in fact in the long run the limiting of car usage will be beneficial to society as a whole this can be seen in three major ways with first public benefits  second cheaper and timesaving methods  and finally the unmatched environmental benefits\\n\\nas people continue to choke from the pain it becomes important to identify the remedy to the problem and limiting car usage is the definitely one of the best ways to reduce the harms the public benefits can be broken down into reduced stress  more space  and increased safety starting off with stress heidrun walter a mother of two children stated that she was always tense when she had a car she now lives in the german city of vauban here most people have given up on cars including mrs walter as a mother of two she ultimately is a strong advocate of car usage limitation with mrs walter businessman carlos arturo plaza stated that its a good opportunity to take away stress these people have already felt their stress decrease with the limitation of car usage and this is a major benefit moving toward space an article written by elisabeth rosenthal in 2009 states in this new approach we will have make it so there is less space for parking with less space for cars there is more space for people not only that but with the increased limit there is a decrease in traffic traffic can be extremely long and in this case it will help to increase public space although traffic does not pose threats to the people safety in the long term car accidents do pose a major threat therefore with their limit there can be an increase in safety for the people moving back to mrs walter she as a mother of two did want the best for her children and above all comes their safety meaning that her choice can also reflect the safety that this limitation produces\\n\\nalthough people do want to benefit as individuals it really comes down to the cost at the end point but limiting car usage is actually not that expensive to the average person in fact by limiting cars alternate transportation is promoted countries such as colombia have move on to bicycles the major of bogotaa city in colombia said that due to the limitation of cars for a day it has seen the constuction of 118 miles of bicycle paths this is cheaper because the prices og bicycles are pale in comparison to cars this means that transport would be so much more affordable now with the increase in bicycle travel there would hardly be any large amounts of traffic and although cars are much faster than bicycles the fact that traffic will be a major factor in travel bicycle travel will be more efficient this ultimately means that by limiting car usage transportation will be cheaper and it will be just as efficient if not more it can be said that it would be difficult to manage bicycle travel but david goldberg an offical of transportation for america said that in countries such as the usa 80 of appropriations have gone to highways this ultimately sets the stone for the construstion of these lanes by limiting car usage these appropriations can be set aside for other means of transportation indeed in the end vauban is correct in calling this smart planning\\n\\nnow comes out the benefits everyone knows about the environmental benefits smog has been one of the largest problems that is choking the people around the world in countries such as china it is elementary that those people as facing large amounts of smog daily but what may not be as common to people is that a country such as france has also started to see a similiar problem pollution in france is actually rivaled by beijingone of the most polluted countries in the world as reported by the chicago tribune on 2014 cars
